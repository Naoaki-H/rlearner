\usage{
rlgb(
  x,
  w,
  y,
  k_folds = NULL,
  p_hat = NULL,
  m_hat = NULL,
  ntrees_max = 1000,
  num_search_rounds = 10,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the input features}

\item{w}{the treatment variable (0 or 1)}

\item{y}{the observed response (real valued)}

\item{k_folds}{number of folds used for cross fitting and cross validation}

\item{p_hat}{pre-computed estimates on E[W|X] corresponding to the input x. rboost will compute it internally if not provided.}

\item{m_hat}{pre-computed estimates on E[Y|X] corresponding to the input x. rboost will compute it internally if not provided.}

\item{ntrees_max}{the maximum number of trees to grow for xgboost}

\item{num_search_rounds}{the number of random sampling of hyperparameter combinations for cross validating on xgboost trees}

\item{print_every_n}{the number of iterations (in each iteration, a tree is grown) by which the code prints out information}

\item{early_stopping_rounds}{the number of rounds the test error stops decreasing by which the cross validation in finding the optimal number of trees stops}

\item{nthread}{the number of threads to use. The default is NULL, which uses all available threads}

\item{verbose}{boolean; whether to print statistic}
}
